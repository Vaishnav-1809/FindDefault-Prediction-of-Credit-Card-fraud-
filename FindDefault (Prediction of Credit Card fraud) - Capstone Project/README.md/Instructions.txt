In order to run the model, please follow the steps below:

1. Download the notebook and run it on google colab
2. The file path in the drive has been provided in the datafile. Download the data into the user's respective local drive or google drive.

Based on the location of the data, the datset set can be read in 2 ways:
  1. If the data has been stored in your local drive:
    - In this case, the code:
          "from google.colab import drive
           drive.mount("/content/drive")" 
      can be converted into a comment in the notebook.
    - You can directly copy the path of the file and paste it within the double quotes in the  pd.read_csv(r" ") function.
 2. If the data has been stored in the google drive: 
  - In this case, you will first need to run the code:
          "from google.colab import drive
           drive.mount("/content/drive")" 
  - Once done, grant access to your google drive.
  - Copy the path of the file from your drive and paste it within the brackets of the  pd.read_csv() function.

3. Once the path has been copied, run the code and have it assigned to a variable which is already provided in the code.
4. Lastly, you an run the entire code to display the findings and visualizations for the various model that were used.
